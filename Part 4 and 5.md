## 1. Enabling a Spatially Varying Wall Temperature in the Python Wrapper

Suppose the original Python wrapper simply reads a constant wall temperature from the configuration. We modify it so that a user can supply a spatial function. For example:

```
import pysu2
from math import sin, pi
from mpi4py import MPI

def main():
    comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD

    # Initialize SU2 driver
    try:
        SU2Driver = pysu2.CSinglezoneDriver('turb_SA_flatplate.cfg', 1, comm)
    except TypeError as exception:
        print('A TypeError occurred in pysu2.CDriver:', exception)
        raise

    # Get the marker ID for 'wall'
    AllMarkerIDs = SU2Driver.GetMarkerIndices()
    MarkerName = 'wall'
    MarkerID = AllMarkerIDs.get(MarkerName, -1)

    if MarkerID >= 0:
        # Get number of vertices and marker coordinates
        nVertex = SU2Driver.GetNumberMarkerNodes(MarkerID)
        marker_coords = SU2Driver.MarkerCoordinates(MarkerID)

        # Apply spatially varying wall temperature
        for i_vertex in range(nVertex):
            x = marker_coords[i_vertex][0]  # âœ… Fixed indexing
            WallTemp = 560.0 - 260.0 * sin(x * pi / 4)
            SU2Driver.SetMarkerCustomTemperature(MarkerID, i_vertex, WallTemp)

    # Run the solver
    SU2Driver.StartSolver()
    SU2Driver.Finalize()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

*Notes:*
- You may need to adjust how boundary locations are stored/used.
- This example assumes the configuration dictionary includes coordinates or that you can compute a representative point for each boundary.

## 2. Addition of New Volume Output: Local Speed of Sound

In the SU2 C++ code, assume that the output routines for volume data (used for Paraview visualization) need to include the local speed of sound. The speed of sound is typically computed as:

\[
a = \sqrt{\gamma \, R \, T}
\]

Where:
- \( \gamma \) is the heat capacity ratio,
- \( R \) is the specific gas constant, and
- \( T \) is the local temperature.

### **Before Correction (Original Output Routine)**
```cpp
// Simplified snippet from the volume output routine
void OutputVolumeData(const Mesh &mesh, const FlowSolution &sol, std::ostream &outputFile) {
    for (const auto &cell : mesh.cells) {
        // Existing outputs: pressure, velocity, temperature, etc.
        outputFile << cell.id << " " << sol.pressure[cell.id] << " " << sol.temperature[cell.id] << "\n";
    }
}
```

### **After Correction (With Speed of Sound)**
```cpp
#include <cmath>

// Assume gamma and R are defined either as constants or read from the configuration.
const double gamma_val = 1.4;
const double gas_constant = 287.0;

void OutputVolumeData(const Mesh &mesh, const FlowSolution &sol, std::ostream &outputFile) {
    for (const auto &cell : mesh.cells) {
        double T = sol.temperature[cell.id]; // Local temperature
        // Compute local speed of sound: a = sqrt(gamma * R * T)
        double local_speed_of_sound = std::sqrt(gamma_val * gas_constant * T);

        // Output cell id, pressure, temperature, and local speed of sound.
        outputFile << cell.id << " " 
                   << sol.pressure[cell.id] << " " 
                   << T << " " 
                   << local_speed_of_sound << "\n";
    }
}
```

### **Updating Screen Output (History File)**
In addition to volume output, you might also want to update the screen output (history log) to include the local speed of sound. For example:

#### **Before Correction (Screen Output)**
```cpp
// Simplified snippet from the history output function
void OutputScreenData(const FlowSolution &sol, int iteration) {
    std::cout << "Iteration: " << iteration 
              << " | Residual: " << sol.residual 
              << " | Lift: " << sol.lift 
              << "\n";
}
```

#### **After Correction (Screen Output with Speed of Sound)**
```cpp
void OutputScreenData(const FlowSolution &sol, int iteration, double avgTemperature) {
    // Compute average local speed of sound from avgTemperature.
    double avg_speed_of_sound = std::sqrt(gamma_val * gas_constant * avgTemperature);
    
    std::cout << "Iteration: " << iteration 
              << " | Residual: " << sol.residual 
              << " | Lift: " << sol.lift 
              << " | Local Speed of Sound: " << avg_speed_of_sound
              << "\n";
}
```

*Notes:*
- The average temperature for screen output can be computed over all cells or over a region of interest.
- Adjust variable names and locations as necessary to match your SU2 code structure.

### Summary of Code Corrections

- **Python Wrapper Modifications:**  
  - Added a function (`wall_temperature_profile`) to compute spatially varying wall temperature.
  - Modified the boundary condition setup to use the new spatial function.

- **C++ Modifications for Volume Output:**  
  - Added a computation of local speed of sound in the volume output routine.
  - Updated the screen output routine to include a new column for the average local speed of sound.
