Assignment 3: Python Wrapper Test Case

Objective

The primary aim of this assignment is to document the progress and successful execution of Assignment 3 for the SU2 GSOC program. This task involves setting up a computational problem using the SU2 Python wrapper, running a test case, and analyzing the obtained results. The purpose of this assignment is to deepen the understanding of the Python-based interface for SU2, enabling smoother interactions and automation of simulation workflows.

Tasks to be Accomplished

To successfully complete this assignment, the following steps must be undertaken:

Problem Definition & Setup:
Configure the SU2 Python wrapper to define the computational problem.
Ensure that all necessary dependencies and environment settings are correctly established.
Load relevant input parameters and mesh files if applicable.
Execution of a Test Case:
Utilize the Python wrapper to run a predefined or custom test case.
Monitor the execution to ensure that the solver runs without errors.
Analysis and Interpretation:
Collect simulation results, including numerical outputs, plots, or convergence histories.
Analyze the results to verify correctness and performance.
